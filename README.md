# Flask-Cloud

A simple and scalable boilerplate for deploying Flask applications to the cloud.

---

## **Description**

This is a starter project for creating a Flask web application that can be easily deployed to various cloud platforms. It includes a minimal Flask application structure, along with configurations for Docker, making it ready for containerization and deployment.

---

## **Features**

* **Flask Boilerplate:** A simple "Hello, World!" Flask application to get you started.
* **Dockerized:** Comes with a `Dockerfile` for easy containerization.
* **Cloud-Ready:** Designed to be deployed to any cloud platform that supports Docker containers.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

* Python 3.x
* Pip
* Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

---
